README - shellscripts
=================

A collection of shell scripts that probably wont be particularly useful for now, but hopefully I'll be getting better at this whole scripting business so keep an eye out :)

Setup
-----

Make the install file executable
  <pre>chmod 755 install.rb</pre>

set up git post-commit hooks to push automatically on commit
  <pre>`./install.rb`</pre>
